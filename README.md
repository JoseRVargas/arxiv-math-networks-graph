## How to reproduce

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<user>/arxiv-math-networks-2020-24.git
cd arxiv-math-networks-graph
conda env create -f environment.yml        # or pip install -r requirements.txt
conda activate math-net
jupyter lab notebooks/graph_analysis.ipynb
```

## Data

The JSON files in data/raw/ were generated from arXiv metadata extracted from "arXiv dataset" on Kaggle*. Each edge carries the weight "weight" = number of articles citing both subtopics.
